To create and add an "About Me" (`README.md`) file to your GitHub profile, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a Repository with the Same Name as Your GitHub Username
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account.
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner of the page, and select **New repository**.
3. In the **Repository name** field, **type your GitHub username exactly**. For example, if your username is `muhammadsaqib`, the repository name should be `muhammadsaqib`.
4. Set the repository to **Public** (this is required to display the profile README).
5. Check the box **Initialize this repository with a README**.
6. Click **Create repository**.

### Step 2: Edit the `README.md` File
1. After creating the repository, you'll see a `README.md` file listed in your repository.
2. Click on the `README.md` file, then click the pencil icon (edit).
3. Add information about yourself in Markdown format. For example:

   ```md
